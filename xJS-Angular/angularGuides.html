    <h1>1. Install TypeScrypt and Angular CLI</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>For using Angular it is a good practice to combine it with using TypeScript. To install TypeScript open command prompt and write the following <span class="cmd">npm install -g typescript</span> and press Enter.</p>
            <p class="note">Note: This step has to be done only once and it will works for all projects because we are installing it with global –g modifier which will install in the folder with all modules and not in the current project folder</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The next step is to install Angular CLI which will allow us to use commands for working with Angular. To install Angular CLI in the command prompt write the following <span class="cmd">npm install -g @angular/cli</span> and press Enter</p>
            <p class="note">Note: This step has to be done only once and it will works for all projects because we are installing it with global –g modifier which will install in the folder with all modules and not in the current project folder</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>2. Creating new Angular project</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>In the command prompt open the folder where you want to start the new project. And then type <span class="cmd">ng new example-project</span> and press Enter</p>
            <p class="note">Note: example-project is an example folder name where our project is created, you can specify another one if you want. Only ng new has to be the same</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Open the new created project with Visual Studio Code and you are ready to start working on the project.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>3. Creating Component</h1>
    <p>We can create our own new component in 2 ways: manually or using the angular cli. First we will see how to create our own new component manually.</p>
    <h2>3.1 Creating Component manually</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>The app folder in src folder is where our components are stored</p>
            <p>We can see our main components holding the start point of project which is app.component.xxx</p>
            <pre class="directory">
    <span class="folder">src</span>
        <span class="folder">app</span> 
            app.component.css
            app.component.html
            app.component.specs.ts
            app.component.ts
            app.module.ts
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>We will create another folder named games in the app folder where we will store our new component. And in the new folder we will create our first needed file games.component.ts which is the typescrypt component</p>
            <p class="note">Note: Folder name “games” is example name, of course we can name our folder the way we want to easier recognize it. Same applies for the file games.component.ts where only the games part is optional and then we must write .component.ts</p>
            <p>If we have done everything correctly our directory should look like: 
                <pre class="directory">
    <span class="folder">src</span>
        <span class="folder">app</span> 
            <span class="folder">games</span>
                games.component.ts 
            app.component.css
            app.component.html
            app.component.specs.ts
            app.component.ts
            app.module.ts
                </pre>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> We will also create the html and css component files in the folder games which is where our new component is placed. And after we are done our directory should look like this:</p>
            <pre class="directory">
    <span class="folder">src</span>
        <span class="folder">app</span> 
            <span class="folder">games</span>
                games.component.css
                games.component.html
                games.component.ts
            app.component.css
            app.component.html
            app.component.specs.ts
            app.component.ts
            app.module.ts
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Now we will add content to the file games.component.ts First we will import Component module to be able to use it. Every class component must has @Component decorator function in which we specify 3 items: The first one is selector which specify in which html element component will be rendered. Template pointing which html file will be our template. And the last property styleUrls is an array with all stylesheets we are going to use.</p>
            <pre class="code-piece">
File: games.component.ts

<span class="purple">import</span> { <span class="lblue">Component</span> } <span class="purple">from</span> <span class="brown">'@angular/core'</span>;

@<span class="yellow">Component</span>(
    {
        <span class="lblue">selector:</span> <span class="brown">'game'</span>,
        <span class="lblue">templateUrl:</span> <span class="brown">'./game.component.html'</span>,
        <span class="lblue">styleUrls:</span> [ <span class="brown">'./game.component.css'</span> ]
    }
)
<span class="purple">export</span> <span class="blue">class</span> <span class="green">GameComponent</span> {
    <span class="lblue">title</span>: <span class="green">string</span> = <span class="brown">"Assassin's Creed"</span>
}
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>We have created our component but the starting point of the project doesn’t know yet so we have to specify it in the app.module.ts file. Before we write anything in it by default it looks like this:</p>
            <pre class="code-piece">
File: app.module.ts
                    
<span class="purple">import</span> { <span class="lblue">BrowserModule</span> } <span class="purple">from</span> <span class="brown">'@angular/platform-browser'</span>;
<span class="purple">import</span> { <span class="lblue">NgModule</span> } <span class="purple">from</span> <span class="brown">'@angular/core'</span>;

<span class="purple">import</span> { <span class="lblue">AppComponent</span> } <span class="purple">from</span> <span class="brown">'./app.component'</span>;

@<span class="yellow">NgModule</span>({
    <span class="lblue">declarations:</span> [
        <span class="lblue">AppComponent</span>
    ],
    <span class="lblue">imports</span> [
        <span class="lblue">BrowserModule</span>
    ],
    <span class="lblue">providers:</span> [],
    <span class="lblue">bootstrap:</span> [<span class="lblue">AppComponent</span>]
})
<span class="purple">export</span> <span class="blue">class</span> <span class="green">AppModule</span> { }
            </pre>
            <p>Now lets tell angular about our new component by importing it and also specify it in the declarations property</p>
            <pre class="code-piece">
File: app.module.ts
                                        
<span class="purple">import</span> { <span class="lblue">BrowserModule</span> } <span class="purple">from</span> <span class="brown">'@angular/platform-browser'</span>;
<span class="purple">import</span> { <span class="lblue">NgModule</span> } <span class="purple">from</span> <span class="brown">'@angular/core'</span>;
                    
<span class="purple">import</span> { <span class="lblue">AppComponent</span> } <span class="purple">from</span> <span class="brown">'./app.component'</span>;
<span class="purple">import</span> { <span class="lblue">GameComponent</span> } <span class="purple">from</span> <span class="brown">'./games/games.component'</span>;
                    
@<span class="yellow">NgModule</span>({
    <span class="lblue">declarations:</span> [
        <span class="lblue">AppComponent</span>,
        <span class="lblue">GameComponent</span>
    ],
    <span class="lblue">imports</span> [
        <span class="lblue">BrowserModule</span>
    ],
    <span class="lblue">providers:</span> [],
    <span class="lblue">bootstrap:</span> [<span class="lblue">AppComponent</span>]
})
<span class="purple">export</span> <span class="blue">class</span> <span class="green">AppModule</span> { }
            </pre>
            <p>We have our component ready but we still need to add content to the html file.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In our ts component file we have specified property title so lets use it in the html. We have only one h1 tag holding the title property from ts file. Using double curly brackets like this is called data binding, meaning that we get data from the ts file and use it in our html template</p>
            <pre class="code-piece">
File: games.component.html
            
    &lt;<span class="blue">h1</span>&gt;{{title}}&lt;/<span class="blue">h1</span>&gt;
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The next step is to use the selector from our ts component file in the parent html template where we want our component to be rendered. In our ts file we named our selector 'game' so to render it we need to name the html element 'game'. We will render it in the parent html file which is app.component.html We will remove some of the html elements from it to make it more simple looking and make it look like this:</p>
            <pre class="code-piece">
File: app.component.html
                                
    &lt;<span class="blue">div</span> <span class="lblue">style</span>=<span class="brown">"text-align:center"</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span class="blue">h1</span>&gt;
            Welcome to {{title}}!
        &lt;/<span class="blue">h1</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span class="blue">img</span> <span class="lblue">width</span>=<span class="brown">"300"</span> <span class="lblue">alt</span>= .....&gt;
    &lt;/<span class="blue">div</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="blue">game</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="blue">game</span>&gt;
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>And now to display everything we have created so far let's run the project. We do that by typing <span class="terminal">ng serve --open</span></p>
            <p>If we have done everything correctly so far in the broswer we should see the following screen</p>
            <img src="./images/screenPart.PNG" alt="angularScreen">
            <p class="note">Note: --open part of the command is to also open the project in the browser, without it we have to open it manually usually on localhost:4200</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
